I am a physician-scientist, company builder, investor, and writer. My
PhD is in Bioinformatics & AI/ML. As a clinical pathologist in training,
I have a particular interest in immunology, molecular genetics,
diagnostics, and therapeutics. As an investor and company builder, I
focus on frontier science applications, especially at the intersection
of biology, healthcare, and AI. I enjoy writing, as well as amplifying
interesting ideas from those around me
